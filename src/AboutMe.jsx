                <p className="p-5 font-semibold">Hi, I’m Maimuna Rahma, a MERN stack developer with a passion for building dynamic, user-friendly applications. My journey into programming started a few years ago, and since then, I’ve honed my skills in MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I love creating seamless user experiences and solving problems with code, whether it’s developing a tech product platform like Gadget Heaven or building a movie portal like Orchid.</p>
                <p className="p-5 font-semibold ">I’m particularly drawn to React for its flexibility in creating interactive, efficient web applications. Outside of coding, I enjoy nature walks, reading books on self-improvement and technology, and exploring new ideas. I believe in continuous growth, both professionally and personally, and I’m always looking for ways to improve and innovate.</p>
                <p>I value collaboration and enjoy working with others to bring ideas to life. Feel free to explore my GitHub to see some of my work, and let’s connect!</p>
